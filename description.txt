This mod is a simple tool which allows mod creators to build world generation structures ingame as opposed to attempting to wrestile with a matrix. simply craft the copy wand for 1 dirt, select 2 points in the world, and right click to save a structure to a file. Your saved structures can be found in Terraria/ModLoader/SavedStructures. In order to generate from one of these files, add a strong refference to this mod and call StructureHelper.GenerateStructure(), the path param should be the path to your file created by this mod, the position param is the top-left of the generation target, and the mod param should be the instance of your mod.
